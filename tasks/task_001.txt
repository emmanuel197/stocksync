# Task ID: 1
# Title: Database Schema Design and Model Creation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for StockSync, creating new models to replace the existing kuandorwear tables.
# Details:
Create Django models for: User (with role-based fields), Organization (multi-tenant), Product, Inventory, Order, OrderItem, Supplier, Buyer, Driver, Notification, and Communication. Include appropriate relationships, indexes, and constraints. Implement migrations to create new tables. Ensure proper normalization and query optimization. Add tenant isolation at the database level for multi-tenant support.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for model validation, relationships, and constraints. Test migrations in a staging environment. Verify query performance with sample data. Ensure proper tenant isolation in multi-tenant scenarios.

3. Add appropriate indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., user role, organization name).
4. Implement custom user manager to handle user creation with organization assignment.
5. Add constraints to ensure data integrity (e.g., unique organization names).
6. Test model creation, validation, and relationship integrity.

## 2. Design and implement Product and Inventory models [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create Product and Inventory models with appropriate relationships and constraints

1. Create Product model with fields: name, SKU, description, category, price, cost, image, barcode, organization (ForeignKey to Organization).
2. Create Inventory model with fields: product (ForeignKey to Product), quantity, location, last_updated, min_stock_level, max_stock_level, organization (ForeignKey).
3. Add unique_together constraint for product and location in Inventory.
4. Implement indexes on frequently queried fields (SKU, category, quantity).
5. Add methods for stock level alerts and inventory valuation.
6. Test inventory operations: adding stock, removing stock, and threshold alerts.

## 3. Design and implement Order and OrderItem models [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create Order and OrderItem models with appropriate relationships to track transactions
### Details:
1. Create Order model with fields: order_number, order_date, status (choices), total_amount, payment_status, organization (ForeignKey), customer_info, shipping_address, notes.
2. Create OrderItem model with fields: order (ForeignKey to Order), product (ForeignKey to Product), quantity, unit_price, subtotal.
3. Add methods to calculate order totals and update inventory on order status changes.
4. Implement indexes on order_number, order_date, and status fields.
5. Add constraints to ensure order items belong to products from the same organization as the order.
6. Test order creation, modification, and the impact on inventory levels.

## 4. Design and implement Supplier, Buyer, and Driver models [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create models for external entities that interact with the inventory system
### Details:
1. Create Supplier model with fields: name, contact_person, email, phone, address, organization (ForeignKey), active_status, payment_terms, supplier_code.
2. Create Buyer model with fields: name, contact_person, email, phone, address, organization (ForeignKey), credit_limit, payment_terms, buyer_code.
3. Create Driver model with fields: name, contact_info, vehicle_details, license_number, organization (ForeignKey), active_status.
4. Add appropriate indexes on name and code fields for quick lookups.
5. Implement methods for supplier performance metrics and buyer credit management.
6. Test relationship integrity between these models and the organization.

## 5. Design and implement Notification and Communication models [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create models to handle system notifications and communication records
### Details:
1. Create Notification model with fields: user (ForeignKey to User), message, timestamp, read_status, notification_type, organization (ForeignKey).
2. Create Communication model with fields: sender (ForeignKey to User), recipient (ForeignKey to User), message, timestamp, read_status, attachment, organization (ForeignKey).
3. Add indexes on timestamp and read_status for efficient querying.
4. Implement methods for marking notifications as read and retrieving unread counts.
5. Add constraints to ensure communications occur within the same organization.
6. Test notification creation, retrieval of unread notifications, and communication between users.

## 6. Implement database normalization and relationship optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Review and optimize the database schema for normalization, performance, and data integrity
### Details:
1. Review all models to ensure they follow 3NF (Third Normal Form) principles.
2. Identify and eliminate data redundancies across models.
3. Optimize foreign key relationships and add appropriate on_delete behaviors.
4. Review and refine field types for optimal storage (e.g., DecimalField for monetary values).
5. Add database-level constraints where appropriate (CHECK constraints, unique constraints).
6. Test database operations to ensure data integrity is maintained during CRUD operations.
7. Document the normalized schema with an ER diagram.

## 7. Implement multi-tenant isolation at database level [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.6
### Description: Ensure proper data isolation between different organizations in the multi-tenant system
### Details:
1. Add organization ForeignKey to all models that need tenant isolation.
2. Create a middleware to automatically filter querysets by the current user's organization.
3. Implement a custom model manager that automatically applies organization filters.
4. Add database-level constraints to prevent cross-organization data access.
5. Create test cases to verify tenant isolation works correctly.
6. Implement organization-specific database views if needed for complex queries.
7. Document the tenant isolation approach for future developers.

## 8. Create and apply database migrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.7
### Description: Generate and apply migrations for all models, ensuring smooth transition from existing schema
### Details:
1. Generate initial migrations for all new models using Django's makemigrations command.
2. Create data migration scripts to transfer data from existing kuandorwear tables to new models if needed.
3. Test migrations in a staging environment before applying to production.
4. Implement a rollback strategy in case of migration failures.
5. Document the migration process and any manual steps required.
6. Apply migrations using Django's migrate command.
7. Verify database schema matches the expected design after migration.
8. Create database indexes for optimizing common queries after migration is complete.
